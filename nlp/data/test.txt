Out of hundreds of thousands of emails seized last month from disgraced former Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a substantial number turned out to be copies of documents already reviewed by F.B.I. agents and analysts, allowing the agency to wrap up in days a review that some had feared would take weeks, if not longer.  The F.B.I. discovered approximately 650,000 emails on a computer that agents had seized while investigating Mr. Weiner on allegations of sexual improprieties. Some of those emails belonged to Huma Abedin, Mr. Weiner's estranged wife and a top aide to Hillary Clinton. As it turned out, law enforcement officials said, there was no need to review all of the emails, only Ms. Abedin's. Those emails numbered in the thousands, and even many of those were duplicates of messages that had been looked at previously, officials said. That allowed the F.B.I. to sort through the emails faster than many, including some at the agency, had expected. "You can't review 650,000 emails in eight days," Donald J. Trump said at a rally on Sunday. Maybe not, but they didn't have to. Here's how federal agents, in the span of a week, could pore over a huge cache of emails and once again conclude that neither Mrs. Clinton nor her aides should face charges related to her handling of classified information on a personal server. The investigation, again, is closed.
